= resque-multi-job-forks

Fast jobs have a very high fork overhead.  
This reduces the overhead of forking by running multiple jobs inside a single fork.

  QUEUE=* MINUTES_PER_FORK=5 rake resque:work # fork lives for 5 minutes
  QUEUE=* rake resque:work # one job per fork as usual


New hook: before_child_exit hook gets called right before the fork terminates:

  Resque.before_child_exit do |worker|
    worker.log("#{worker.jobs_processed} were processed in this fork")
  end
